# K-Means Clustering of Hand Written Digits
The K-Means algorithm algorithm searches for a pre-determined number of clusters within an unlabeled multidimensional dataset.
Implementation:
- MNIST Dataset used for K Means Clustering.
- Data normalized so that each input parameter has a similar data distribution.
- Function input takes in a list of N data vectors to be clustered and outputs a list of N group assignment indicies which indicate the association of each data vector to a specific group.
